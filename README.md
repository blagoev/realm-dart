Realm is a mobile database that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables.
This repository holds the source code for the Realm SDK for Flutter™ and Dart™

**This project is in experimental stage, it should not be used in production.**

The preview version of Realm SDK for Flutter and Dart allows working with a local Realm database in Dart standalone and Flutter. It provides the functionality for creating, retrieving, querying, sorting, filtering, updating Realm objects and supports change notifications.

This Realm SDK is implemented as a Dart library and a native code library which is loaded in the application by the user code. 

Flutter Hot Reload is available only when running on the Android x86 Emulator.

Running on a real Android device always includes the libraries in release mode.
